                            <p>
                                Pastor Lenze is a native Pennsylvanian who accepted Christ as his Savior at 18 years
                                old. After graduating from Bible college, he served in Christian education for several
                                years until the Lord directed him into pastoral ministry. Most recently, God led Pastor
                                Lenze and his family to Victory Baptist Church, where he now serves with a heart for
                                discipleship, encouragement, and community outreach.
                                Pastor Leo and his wife, Leann, have been joyfully married since 1995 and are blessed
                                with four adult children. Their family has a deep love for the local church and a
                                passion for seeing lives transformed through the gospel.

                            <h3>God</h3>
                            <p>
                                We believe in One God Who is eternal, self-existent, infinite, and immutable. We believe He
                                has one nature, one essence, and one substance; yet manifests Himself to man in three
                                Persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. (Deuteronomy 6:4; I Timothy 1:17; James
                                1:17; I John 4:4)

                            <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                            <p>
                                We believe Jesus Christ to be the one and only Saviour of mankind. We believe Jesus Christ
                                to be eternally God and to possess all the attributes of Deity. We believe that the Lord Jesus
                                Christ was virgin-born, that He was God incarnation, and that the purpose of the incarnation
                                was to reveal God, to redeem men, and to rule over God&#39;s kingdom. We believe Jesus Christ
                                never relinquished any attributes of His Deity, but merely veiled them. We believe He lived a
                                perfect, sinless life, at the end of which He was offered for all mankind as a substitutionary
                                sacrifice for man&#39;s sin. This sacrifice was a just payment to God for the forgiveness of sin. It
                                was activated by Jesus&#39; death through the shedding of His blood on the cross and was
                                accepted by God upon His resurrection. We believe He ascended into Heaven after His
                                resurrection to be seated at the right hand of the Father and is now waiting for the time of
                                receiving His church at the rapture, which is followed by His return seven years later to earth
                                to rule and reign as King for 1,000 years. (Psalm 2:7-9; Isaiah 7:14, 9:6, 43:11; Micah 5:2;
                                Matthew 1:25; Luke 1:26-35; John 1:1, 1:3, 14, 18, 29; Romans 3:19-25; Romans 5:6-15;
                                Philippians 2:5-11; I Thessalonians 4:13-18; I Timothy 2:5; I Timothy 3:16; Titus 2:10-15;
                                Hebrews 7:26, 9:24-28; I Peter 1:19, 2:2; I John 1:3; Revelation 20:1-6)

                            <p>
                                We believe the Holy Spirit of God is a person who has personality and all the attributes of
                                Deity. We believe the Holy Spirit has always been involved in the affairs of mankind;
                                however, we believe He has a special ministry that began at Pentecost and will continue until
                                the rapture. This ministry includes reproving the world of sin, righteousness, and judgement.
                                The Holy Spirit was also sent to regenerate, sanctify, seal, and fill all who have placed their
                                faith in Jesus Christ. (Genesis 1:2; John 3:5-6; John 14:16; Acts 1:5; Acts 11:15; I
                                Corinthians 3:16; I Corinthians 6:19-20; I Corinthians 12:13)

                            <h3>Sin and Salvation</h3>
                            <p>
                                We believe all men were born with an inherited sin nature received from our common
                                ancestor, Adam. We believe that because of his sin nature, man is totally incapable of
                                reforming himself or ceasing from his sin by his own power. We believe the only hope of
                                deliverance for man is a total change of man concerning his sinful condition and inability to
                                change it, and a turning to Jesus Christ as the only Saviour. We believe that only through the
                                substitutionary sacrifice of Christ on the cross can a man be delivered from his sin. We
                                believe all those who reject Jesus Christ as their Saviour are already condemned to an
                                eternity in the lake of fire. (Genesis 5:1-5; Acts 4:19; Acts 16:31; Romans 3:10-23; Romans
                                5:6-12; Romans 6:23; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6; Revelation 20:11-14)

                            <h3>The New Testament Church</h3>
                            <p>
                                We believe the local church is composed of members who have been saved and baptized
                                according to the command of Christ and have voluntarily united together for the purposes of
                                worship, fellowship, service, and observance of the ordinances of baptism and communion.
                                We believe all true believers will be taken up at the rapture, just prior to the tribulation.
                                (Matthew 16:16-18; Acts 1:15; Acts 2:41-43; Acts 11:15; Acts 20:28; I Corinthians 15:51-58;
                                Ephesians 1:12-14; Ephesians 5:25-30; I Thessalonians 4:13-18; I Timothy 3:4-15)

                            <p>
                                We believe in the literal interpretation of the Scriptures in their grammatical and historical
                                context. We believe in the pre-tribulation rapture of the church saints, followed by the seven-
                                year tribulation. We believe in the pre-millennial return of Christ to the earth and His literal
                                rule of 1,000 years. Following this one-thousand-year reign will be the Great White Throne
                                judgment and then the new heaven and new earth. (I Corinthians 15:51-58; I Thessalonians
